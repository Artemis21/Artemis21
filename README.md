Hi! I'm Artemis, she/her pronouns. I write code for fun, mainly in Rust these
days but still with a fair amount of Python. I also know Javascript pretty well
and sometimes write web frontends. Historically, I have a lot of experience in
writing Discord bots, but I don't do that so much anymore.

You can find my contact information at [arty.li].

My favourite projects:
 - [ShareIt], a highly customisable pastebin, file uploader and link shortener.
 - [ptrace-inject], a DLL injector for Linux.
 - [Cupid], a Discord bot for managing complex roleplay relationships.

You should read [Blaine Hansen's *Hopeful Path*][hopeful-path].
