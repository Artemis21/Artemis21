Hi! I'm Artemis. I write code for fun, mainly in Rust these days but still with
a fair amount of Python. I also know Javascript pretty well and sometimes write
web frontends. Historically, I have a lot of experience in writing Discord bots,
but I don't do that so much anymore.

My favourite projects:
 - [**ShareIt**](https://github.com/pls-shareit), a highly customisable pastebin, file uploader and link shortener.
 - [**ptrace-inject**](https://github.com/Artemis21/ptrace-inject), a DLL injector for Linux.
 - [**Cupid**](https://github.com/cupid-bot), a Discord bot for managing complex roleplay relationships.
