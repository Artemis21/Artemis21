Hi! I'm Miriam (aka Artemis), she/her pronouns. I'm a computer science student and I also write code for fun -- often in
Rust, but sometimes in Python or the JavaScript framework of the week. Lots of my older projects are Discord bots for one
purpose or another.

You can find my contact information at [arty.li].

My favourite projects:
 - [ptrace-inject], a DLL injector for Linux.
 - [Beatdrop], a guess-that-tune music guessing game inspired by the sadly discontinued Heardle.
 - [ShareIt], a customisable pastebin, file uploader and link shortener.
